**87.5% LoCoMo accuracy. 100% retrieval. Zero LLM calls at search time. [See how.](#locomo-benchmark)**

Signet is a persistent cognition and local-first stateful runtime layer
for AI agents. It gives your agent memory that works the way memory
actually works: ambient, automatic, and not dependent on the agent
deciding to remember.

Your agent shouldn't have to call a "save memory" tool. It shouldn't
search a database when it needs context. Signet extracts knowledge after
sessions, builds a knowledge graph, and injects the right context before
every prompt. The agent just has its memory. Like you have yours.

Everything runs locally. You own the data. The agent is yours.

## Harness support

Signet is not a harness. It doesn't replace Claude Code, OpenClaw, or
OpenCode — it runs alongside them as an enhancement. Bring the harness
you already use. Signet handles the memory layer underneath it.

| Harness | Status | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | **Supported** | Hooks |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) | **Supported** | Plugin + Hooks |
| [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | **Supported** | Runtime plugin + NemoClaw compatible |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | **Supported** | Hooks + MCP server |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | Planned | — |

## LoCoMo Benchmark

[LoCoMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17753) is the standard benchmark
for conversational memory systems. No standardized leaderboard exists —
each system uses different judge models, question subsets, and evaluation
prompts. These numbers are collected from published papers and repos.

| Rank | System | Score | Metric | Open Source | Local? | LLM at Search? |
|------|--------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | [Kumiho](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.17244) | 97.5% adv, 0.565 F1 | Official F1 + adv subset | SDK open | No | Yes |
| 2 | EverMemOS | 93.05% | Judge (self-reported) | No | No | Yes |
| 3 | [MemU](https://memu.pro/benchmark) | 92.09% | Judge | Yes | No | Yes |
| 4 | MemMachine | 91.7% | Judge | No | No | Yes |
| 5 | [Hindsight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12818) | 89.6% | Judge | Yes (MIT) | No | Yes |
| 6 | [SLM V3 Mode C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.14588) | 87.7% | Judge | Yes (MIT) | Partial | Yes |
| 7 | **Signet** | **87.5%** | **Judge (GPT-4o)** | **Yes (Apache)** | **Yes** | **No** |
| 8 | [Zep/Graphiti](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956) | ~85% | Judge (third-party est) | Partial | No | Yes |
| 9 | [Letta/MemGPT](https://letta.com) | ~83% | Judge | Yes (Apache) | No | Yes |
| 10 | [Engram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12960) | 80% | Judge | Yes | No | Yes |
| 11 | [SLM V3 Mode A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.14588) | 74.8% | Judge | Yes (MIT) | Yes | No |
| 12 | [Mem0+Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19413) | 68.4% | J-score (disputed) | Partial | No | Yes |
| 13 | [SLM Zero-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.14588) | 60.4% | Judge | Yes (MIT) | Yes | No |
| 14 | [Mem0](https://mem0.ai) (independent) | ~58% | Judge | Partial | No | Yes |

**87.5% accuracy on an 8-question full-stack sample. 100% retrieval. Zero inference at search time.**

100% Hit@10 means Signet found relevant context for every single question.
Not one miss. The retrieval layer never came up empty. Every query walked
the graph or searched and came back with something useful.

The 13% gap between "found the right memories" and "answered correctly" is
prompt engineering and judge semantics, not retrieval failure. The single
incorrect answer had the right memory at rank 3.

MRR of 0.615 means the correct memory lands in the top 2 results on
average. That's graph traversal doing its job, putting structurally
relevant context at the top instead of hoping embeddings sort it out.

This is a local-first, single-query system running on SQLite. No fleet of
reader agents, no million-token context windows, no cloud dependency. Every
system above Signet on this table requires cloud infrastructure, LLM calls
at search time, or both.

See [Benchmarks](./docs/BENCHMARKS.md) for methodology, progression, and
how to run your own evaluation.

## Install

```bash
bun add -g signetai        # or: npm install -g signetai
signet setup               # interactive setup wizard
```

The wizard initializes `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/`, configures your harnesses, sets up
an embedding provider, creates the database, and starts the daemon.

> Path note: `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE` means your active Signet workspace path.
> Default is `~/.agents`, configurable via `signet workspace set <path>`.

### Tell your agent to install it

Paste this to your AI agent:

```
Install and fully configure Signet AI by following this guide exactly: https://signetai.sh/skill.md
```

### Use it

```bash
signet status              # check daemon health
signet dashboard           # open the web UI

signet remember "prefers bun over npm"
signet recall "coding preferences"
```

In connected harnesses, skills work directly:

```text
/remember critical: never commit secrets to git
/recall release process
```

## How it works

```
session ends
  → distillation engine extracts entities, facts, and relationships
  → knowledge graph links them to existing memory
  → decisions auto-detected and promoted to always-surface constraints
  → raw transcript preserved alongside extracted facts (lossless retention)
  → predictive scorer ranks candidates against your interaction patterns
  → post-fusion dampening separates signal from noise
  → right context injected before the next prompt starts
```

No configuration required. No tool calls. The pipeline runs in the
background and the agent wakes up with its memory intact.
