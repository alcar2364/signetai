# Secrets Management

Encrypted storage for API keys and sensitive values. Agents can *use* secrets without being able to read or expose them.

---

## How It Works

The core problem with AI agents and secrets: if an agent can read `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment, a prompt injection attack or a careless response could leak it.

Signet's solution: secrets are encrypted at rest, and agents never receive decrypted values. When a secret is needed (for embeddings, tool calls, etc.), the [[daemon]] resolves it internally — either by using the value directly in API calls or by injecting it into a subprocess environment that the agent cannot inspect.

---

## Storage

```
$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/
└── .secrets/
    └── secrets.enc     # Encrypted secret store (JSON, mode 0600)
```

The `secrets.enc` file is JSON, but every value is encrypted individually. It's readable by humans as a list of names and metadata, but the actual values are ciphertext.

### Encryption

- **Algorithm:** XSalsa20-Poly1305 via libsodium (`crypto_secretbox_easy`)
- **Key derivation:** BLAKE2b hash of `signet:secrets:<machine-id>` stretched to 32 bytes
- **Machine ID:** reads `/etc/machine-id` (Linux) or `IOPlatformUUID` (macOS); falls back to `hostname-username`
- **Nonces:** random, prepended to each ciphertext
- **File permissions:** `0600` (owner read/write only)

The master key is bound to the machine, so the encrypted file cannot be decrypted on another computer without the same machine ID.

## [[cli|CLI]] Commands

### Add a secret

```bash
signet secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
# Prompts: Enter value: ••••••••
# ✓ Secret OPENAI_API_KEY saved
```

The value is never echoed. Prompt input is hidden.

### List secrets

```bash
signet secret list
# OPENAI_API_KEY
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Only names are shown — never values.

### Check if a secret exists

```bash
signet secret has OPENAI_API_KEY
# true
```

### Delete a secret

```bash
signet secret delete GITHUB_TOKEN
# ✓ Secret GITHUB_TOKEN deleted
```

### 1Password integration

```bash
# Connect using a service account token (prompted if omitted)
signet secret onepassword connect

# Check status and list vaults
signet secret onepassword status
signet secret onepassword vaults

# Import password-like fields from selected vaults
signet secret onepassword import --vault Engineering --prefix OP

# Disconnect and remove stored service account token
signet secret onepassword disconnect
```

Imported values are stored as regular Signet secrets with generated names,
and `secret_exec` can also reference 1Password secrets directly via
`op://vault/item/field` when connected.

### Export / import (planned)

```bash
signet secret export > secrets.enc.backup
signet secret import < secrets.enc.backup
```

---

## Dashboard UI

The [[dashboard]]'s **Settings -> Secrets** panel lets you:

- View all secret names (values always masked as `•••••`)
- Add new secrets via an input form
- Delete secrets
- Connect/disconnect a 1Password service account token
- Select vaults and import password-like fields into Signet secrets

There is intentionally no "reveal" button — the UI never has access to secret values.

---

## Using Secrets in Config

Reference a stored secret in `agent.yaml` with the `$secret:NAME` syntax:

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: openai
  model: text-embedding-3-small
  api_key: $secret:OPENAI_API_KEY
```

The daemon resolves `$secret:NAME` references internally when making API calls. The actual value never appears in the config file or the agent's context.

---

## Executing Commands with Secrets

The daemon can spawn a subprocess with secrets injected into its environment. The agent provides references (names), not values.

**HTTP API:**

```http
POST /api/secrets/exec
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "command": "curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models",
  "secrets": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "DB_PASSWORD": "op://Engineering/Prod DB/password"
  }
}
```

The map is `{ env_var_name: secret_reference }` where a reference can be a
stored Signet secret name or a 1Password `op://...` reference. The daemon:
1. Resolves each secret reference to its value
2. Spawns the subprocess with the resolved values in the environment
3. Returns stdout/stderr with any secret values redacted from the output

**Response:**

```json
{
  "stdout": "...",
  "stderr": "",
  "code": 0
}
```

If a secret value appears anywhere in stdout or stderr, it is replaced with `[REDACTED]`.

---

## Security Model

**What the daemon does:**
- Reads the machine ID from `/etc/machine-id` or equivalent
- Derives a 32-byte master key using BLAKE2b
- Encrypts each secret value with a random nonce
- Stores ciphertext in `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.secrets/secrets.enc` at `0600`

**What agents can't do:**
- Read secret values from config files or environment
- Inspect subprocess environments
- Enumerate secret values through the API (only names)
- Access the `GET /api/secrets/:name` route (there is none — only `POST`, `DELETE`, and `GET /api/secrets` for names)

**What you should know:**
- The master key is machine-bound, not passphrase-protected by default. If someone has shell access as your user, they can derive the key.
- Passphrase-protected keys are planned for a future version.
- Don't commit `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.secrets/` to version control. Add it to `.gitignore`.
- Secrets are zeroed from memory (best-effort in JavaScript) after use.

## API Reference

The full secrets API is documented in [API.md](./API.md#secrets-api). Summary:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/secrets` | GET | List secret names |
| `/api/secrets/:name` | POST | Store a secret |
| `/api/secrets/:name` | DELETE | Delete a secret |
| `/api/secrets/exec` | POST | Execute command with one or more secrets injected |
| `/api/secrets/:name/exec` | POST | Legacy single-secret exec |
| `/api/secrets/1password/status` | GET | 1Password integration status |
| `/api/secrets/1password/connect` | POST | Connect/save service account token |
| `/api/secrets/1password/connect` | DELETE | Disconnect/remove stored token |
| `/api/secrets/1password/vaults` | GET | List accessible 1Password vaults |
| `/api/secrets/1password/import` | POST | Import vault secrets into Signet |

## Planned Improvements

- **Passphrase protection** — optional user passphrase added to key derivation (Argon2)
- **OS keychain backend** — macOS Keychain, GNOME Keyring, Windows Credential Manager
- **Export/import** — encrypted backup bundles for moving between machines
- **Team secrets** — shared encrypted secrets via asymmetric encryption
- **Audit log** — log of secret usage (not values)
