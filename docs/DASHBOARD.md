Dashboard
=========

The Signet dashboard is a SvelteKit static app served by the [[daemon]] at
`http://localhost:3850`. It is a supplementary visual interface — useful
for browsing [[memory]], editing config files, and inspecting daemon state,
but not the primary way to interact with Signet. The [[cli|CLI]] and
[[harnesses|harness]] integrations are the primary interfaces.


Accessing the Dashboard
-----------------------

The daemon must be running first:

```bash
signet start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3850` in your browser, or run:

```bash
signet dashboard
```

The `signet dashboard` command opens your default browser. If the daemon
is not already running, it starts it first.


Layout
------

The dashboard is a single-page app with three regions:

- **Left sidebar** — agent identity summary, connector status, and a
  file list for config editing.
- **Center panel** — the main tabbed workspace.
- **Right sidebar** — a compact memory panel with quick search. Hidden
  when the Memory tab is active.

The header shows daemon version, total memory count, and connected
harness count.


Left Sidebar
------------

The left sidebar has three sections.

**Identity** shows the agent name and creature type from `IDENTITY.md`,
plus a quick count of total memories and active connectors.

**Connectors** lists each configured harness (Claude Code, OpenCode,
OpenClaw, etc.) and whether the harness config file exists on disk. A
green indicator means the file is present and the harness is synced. If
a connector shows `OFF`, run `signet sync` or save `AGENTS.md` to
trigger a re-sync.

**Config Files** lists all `.md` and `.yaml` files found in `~/.agents/`.
Clicking a file opens it in the Config editor.


Tabs
----

**Config** — A CodeMirror 6 editor for your agent's identity files.
Files are loaded from `~/.agents/`. The editor provides syntax
highlighting (markdown for `.md` files, YAML for `.yaml`), line
numbers, bracket matching, fold gutters, search (`Ctrl+F`), and undo
history. Use `Cmd+S` / `Ctrl+S` to save. Saving `AGENTS.md` triggers
harness sync within 2 seconds. The editor uses a custom dark theme
matching the dashboard design language, with a light theme variant
activated by the `data-theme="light"` attribute.

**Settings** — A YAML editor (also CodeMirror 6) for `agent.yaml`.
Modify embedding provider, pipeline V2 flags, search settings, memory
retention windows, and auth configuration without leaving the browser.
Changes are saved directly to `~/.agents/agent.yaml`.

**Memory** — Browse and search your memory database. Search runs hybrid
(semantic + keyword) lookup. You can filter by type, tags, source
harness, pinned status, importance score, and date. Each memory card has
a "Find Similar" button that runs a vector similarity search. The count
shown reflects your current filter state.

**Embeddings** — A 3D force-directed graph of your memory space
(powered by `3d-force-graph` / Three.js). Memories with vector
embeddings appear as nodes; edges connect k-nearest neighbors.

Coordinates are computed server-side via UMAP dimensionality reduction
(`GET /api/embeddings/projection`) and cached until the embedding count
changes. The server returns both 2D and 3D projections; the dashboard
uses the 3D variant. Node positions are scaled by a factor of 52 and
seeded from the UMAP coordinates; the force simulation refines layout
from there.

Nodes are colored by source (the `who` field). Node size scales with
importance (base 0.6, up to 2.0). Click a node to inspect the memory
and view its nearest neighbors in a side panel. Hovering a node shows
a tooltip with the source and a truncated content label.

Filter presets let you slice the graph by source, memory type, or
importance range. Preset selections are persisted to `localStorage`.

**Cluster lens mode** highlights a selected node's neighborhood:
when active, only nodes in the `lensIds` set are rendered at full
opacity while the rest are dimmed. Edges are similarly filtered.
Pinned memories are visually distinguished.

The `EmbeddingCanvas3D` component exposes `focusNode(id)` to animate
the camera toward a specific node, and `refreshAppearance()` to
re-apply color/opacity changes without rebuilding the graph.

**Logs** — Real-time daemon log stream via Server-Sent Events
(`/api/logs/stream`). A Live/Stop toggle controls the stream.
Entries are color-coded by level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)
and labeled by category: `daemon`, `api`, `memory`, `sync`, `git`,
`watcher`, `embedding`, `harness`, `system`, `hooks`, `pipeline`,
`skills`, `secrets`, `auth`, `session-tracker`, `summary-worker`,
`document-worker`, `maintenance`, `retention`, `llm`. Click an
entry to open a split detail panel with the full JSON payload,
duration display, and a copy-to-clipboard button.

**Secrets** — Shows stored secret names. Values are always masked. You
can add new secrets (via a password input) or delete existing ones. For
CLI use, prefer `signet secret put <NAME>`.

**Skills** — Lists installed skills and lets you browse the skills.sh
registry. Click a skill name to read its full `SKILL.md` before
installing. Already-installed skills are marked.


API-Only Fallback
-----------------

If the dashboard build is missing (e.g., running the daemon from source
without building the frontend), visiting `http://localhost:3850` shows
a minimal HTML page listing available API endpoints instead.

Build the dashboard to restore the full UI:

```bash
cd packages/cli/dashboard
bun run build
```


Development
-----------

To run the dashboard in dev mode with hot reload:

```bash
cd packages/cli/dashboard
bun install
bun run dev
```

This starts a Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173`. The daemon
must still be running at port 3850 for API calls to work.


Tasks Tab
---------

The Tasks tab shows a kanban board for scheduled agent prompts. Four
columns display task state:

- **Scheduled** — Enabled tasks waiting for their next run
- **Running** — Currently executing tasks with elapsed timer
- **Completed** — Recent successful runs
- **Failed** — Recent failed runs with error summary

Each card shows the task name, harness badge, cron schedule, and
next/last run time. Click a card to open the detail sheet with full
run history and stdout/stderr logs.

Use the **+ New Task** button to create tasks. The form includes
cron presets, harness selection, and a security warning for Claude
Code's `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag.

Tasks can be enabled/disabled via the toggle switch on each card,
or triggered for an immediate manual run.


Port Configuration
------------------

The default port is 3850. To change it:

```bash
SIGNET_PORT=4000 signet start
```

The dashboard URL changes accordingly.
