Configuration Reference
=======================

Complete reference for all Signet configuration options. For initial setup,
see [[quickstart]]. For the [[daemon]] runtime, see [[architecture]].


Configuration Files
-------------------

All files live in your active Signet workspace.

- Default workspace: `~/.agents/`
- Persisted workspace setting: `~/.config/signet/workspace.json`
- Override for a single process: `SIGNET_PATH=/some/path`

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent.yaml` | Main configuration and manifest |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent identity and instructions (synced to harnesses) |
| `SOUL.md` | Personality and tone |
| `MEMORY.md` | Working memory summary (auto-generated) |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Optional identity metadata (name, creature, vibe) |
| `USER.md` | Optional user preferences and profile |

The loader checks `agent.yaml`, `AGENT.yaml`, and `config.yaml` in that
order, using the first file it finds. All sections are optional; omitting
a section falls back to the documented defaults.


Workspace selection and persistence
-----------------------------------

Use the CLI to inspect or change the default workspace path:

```bash
signet workspace status
signet workspace set ~/.openclaw/workspace
```

`signet workspace set` is idempotent. It safely migrates files, stores the
new default workspace in `~/.config/signet/workspace.json`, and updates
detected OpenClaw-family configs to keep `agents.defaults.workspace` aligned.

Resolution order for the effective workspace is:

1. `--path` CLI option
2. `SIGNET_PATH` environment variable
3. Stored CLI workspace setting (`~/.config/signet/workspace.json`)
4. Default `~/.agents/`


agent.yaml
----------

The primary configuration file. Created by `signet setup` and editable
via `signet configure` or the dashboard's config editor.

### agent

Core agent identity metadata.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Agent display name |
| `description` | string | no | Short description |
| `created` | string | yes | ISO 8601 creation timestamp |
| `updated` | string | yes | ISO 8601 last update timestamp |


### owner

Optional owner identification. Reserved for future ERC-8128 verification.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `address` | string | Ethereum wallet address |
| `localId` | string | Local user identifier |
| `ens` | string | ENS domain name |
| `name` | string | Human-readable name |


### harnesses

List of AI platforms to integrate with. Valid values: `claude-code`,
`opencode`, `openclaw`. Support for `cursor`, `windsurf`, `chatgpt`, and
`gemini` is planned.


### embedding

Vector embedding configuration for semantic memory search.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string | `"ollama"` | `"ollama"` or `"openai"` |
| `model` | string | `"nomic-embed-text"` | Embedding model name |
| `dimensions` | number | `768` | Output vector dimensions |
| `base_url` | string | `"http://localhost:11434"` | Ollama API base URL |
| `api_key` | string | — | API key or `$secret:NAME` reference |

Recommended Ollama models:

| Model | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| `nomic-embed-text` | 768 | Default; good quality/speed balance |
| `all-minilm` | 384 | Faster, smaller vectors |
| `mxbai-embed-large` | 1024 | Better quality, more resource usage |

Recommended OpenAI models:

| Model | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 | Cost-effective |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 3072 | Highest quality |

Rather than putting an API key in plain text, store it with
`signet secret put OPENAI_API_KEY` and reference it as:

```yaml
api_key: $secret:OPENAI_API_KEY
```


### search

Hybrid search tuning. Controls the blend between semantic (vector) and
keyword (BM25) retrieval.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `alpha` | number | `0.7` | Vector weight 0-1. Higher = more semantic. |
| `top_k` | number | `20` | Candidate count fetched from each source |
| `min_score` | number | `0.3` | Minimum combined score to return a result |

At `alpha: 0.9` results are heavily semantic, suitable for conceptual
queries. At `alpha: 0.3` results skew toward keyword matching, better for
exact-phrase lookups. The default of `0.7` works well generally.


### memory

Memory system settings.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `database` | string | `"memory/memories.db"` | SQLite path (relative to the active workspace) |
| `session_budget` | number | `2000` | Character limit for session context injection |
| `decay_rate` | number | `0.95` | Daily importance decay factor for non-pinned memories |

Non-pinned memories lose importance over time using the formula:

```
importance(t) = base_importance × decay_rate^days_since_access
```

Accessing a memory resets the decay timer.


### memory.synthesis

Configuration for periodic `MEMORY.md` regeneration. The synthesis
process reads all memories and asks a model to write a coherent summary.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `harness` | string | `"openclaw"` | Which harness runs synthesis |
| `model` | string | `"sonnet"` | Model identifier |
| `schedule` | string | `"daily"` | `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, or `"on-demand"` |
| `max_tokens` | number | `4000` | Max output tokens |


Pipeline V2 Config
------------------

The V2 [[pipeline|memory pipeline]] lives at `packages/daemon/src/pipeline/`. It runs
LLM-based fact extraction against incoming conversation text, then decides
whether to write new memories, update existing ones, or skip. Config lives
under `memory.pipelineV2` in `agent.yaml`.

The config uses a nested structure with grouped sub-objects. Legacy flat
keys (e.g. `extractionModel`, `workerPollMs`) are still supported for
backward compatibility, but nested keys take precedence when both are
present.

Enable the pipeline:

```yaml
memory:
  pipelineV2:
    enabled: true
    shadowMode: true        # extract without writing — safe first step
    extraction:
      provider: ollama
      model: qwen3:4b
```


### Control flags

These top-level boolean fields gate major pipeline behaviors.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch. Pipeline does nothing when false. |
| `shadowMode` | `false` | Extract facts but skip writes. Useful for evaluation. |
| `mutationsFrozen` | `false` | Allow reads; block all writes. Overrides `shadowMode`. |
| `semanticContradictionEnabled` | `false` | Enable LLM-based semantic contradiction detection for UPDATE/DELETE proposals. |
| `telemetryEnabled` | `false` | Enable anonymous telemetry reporting. |

The relationship between `shadowMode` and `mutationsFrozen` matters:
`shadowMode` suppresses writes from the normal extraction path only;
`mutationsFrozen` is a harder freeze that blocks all write paths
including repairs and graph updates.


### Extraction (`extraction`)

Controls the LLM-based extraction stage. Supports multiple providers.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `provider` | `"claude-code"` | — | `"ollama"`, `"openai"`, `"claude-code"`, `"opencode"`, `"codex"`, or `"native"` |
| `model` | `"haiku"` | — | Model name for the configured provider |
| `timeout` | `45000` | 5000-300000 ms | Extraction call timeout |
| `minConfidence` | `0.7` | 0.0-1.0 | Confidence threshold; facts below this are dropped |

When using `ollama`, the model must be available locally. When using
`claude-code`, the Claude Code CLI must be on PATH. `codex` uses the
Codex harness as the extraction provider. `native` uses the
`@signet/native` Rust/NAPI module for local vector operations. Lower
`minConfidence` to capture more facts at the cost of noise; raise it
to write only high-confidence facts.


### Worker (`worker`)

The pipeline processes jobs through a queue with lease-based concurrency
control.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `pollMs` | `2000` | 100-60000 ms | How often the worker polls for pending jobs |
| `maxRetries` | `3` | 1-10 | Max retry attempts before a job goes to dead-letter |
| `leaseTimeoutMs` | `300000` | 10000-600000 ms | Time before an uncompleted job lease expires |

A job that exceeds `maxRetries` moves to dead-letter status and is
eventually purged by the retention worker.


### Knowledge Graph (`graph`)

When `graph.enabled: true`, the pipeline builds entity-relationship links
from extracted facts and uses them to boost search relevance.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | — | Enable knowledge graph building and querying |
| `boostWeight` | `0.15` | 0.0-1.0 | Weight applied to graph-neighbor score boost |
| `boostTimeoutMs` | `500` | 50-5000 ms | Timeout for graph lookup during search |


### Hints (`hints`)

Prospective indexing generates hypothetical future queries at write
time. These "hints" are indexed in FTS5 so memories match by
anticipated cue, not just stored content. For example, a memory about
"switched from PostgreSQL to SQLite" might generate hints like
"database migration", "why SQLite", and "storage engine decision" —
queries the user is likely to ask later.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | — | Enable prospective indexing |
| `max` | `5` | 1-20 | Maximum hints generated per memory |
| `timeout` | `30000` | 5000-120000 ms | Hint generation LLM timeout |
| `maxTokens` | `256` | 32-1024 | Max tokens for hint generation |
| `poll` | `5000` | 1000-60000 ms | Job polling interval |

```yaml
memory:
  pipelineV2:
    hints:
      enabled: true
      max: 5
      timeout: 30000
      maxTokens: 256
      poll: 5000
```


### Traversal (`traversal`)

Graph traversal controls how the knowledge graph is walked during
retrieval. When `primary: true`, graph traversal produces the base
candidate pool and flat search fills gaps. When `primary: false`,
traditional hybrid search runs first with graph boost as
supplementary.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | — | Enable graph traversal |
| `primary` | `true` | — | Use traversal as primary retrieval strategy |
| `maxAspectsPerEntity` | `10` | 1-50 | Max aspects to collect per entity |
| `maxAttributesPerAspect` | `20` | 1-100 | Max attributes per aspect |
| `maxDependencyHops` | `10` | 1-50 | Max hops for dependency walking |
| `minDependencyStrength` | `0.3` | 0.0-1.0 | Minimum edge strength to follow |
| `maxBranching` | `4` | 1-20 | Max branching factor during traversal |
| `maxTraversalPaths` | `50` | 1-500 | Max paths to explore |
| `minConfidence` | `0.5` | 0.0-1.0 | Minimum confidence for results |
| `timeoutMs` | `500` | 50-5000 ms | Traversal timeout |
| `boostWeight` | `0.2` | 0.0-1.0 | Weight for traversal boost in hybrid search |
| `constraintBudgetChars` | `1000` | 100-10000 | Character budget for constraint injection |

```yaml
memory:
  pipelineV2:
    traversal:
      enabled: true
      primary: true
      maxAspectsPerEntity: 10
      maxAttributesPerAspect: 20
      maxDependencyHops: 10
      minDependencyStrength: 0.3
      maxBranching: 4
      maxTraversalPaths: 50
      minConfidence: 0.5
      timeoutMs: 500
      boostWeight: 0.2
      constraintBudgetChars: 1000
```

The `primary` flag determines the retrieval strategy. In primary mode,
entities are extracted from the query, the graph is walked to collect
related memories, and flat hybrid search only runs to fill remaining
slots. In supplementary mode (`primary: false`), the standard hybrid
search runs first and traversal results are blended in using
`boostWeight`. Primary mode is faster for entity-dense queries;
supplementary mode is more conservative and better for freeform text.


### Reranker (`reranker`)

An optional reranking pass that runs after initial retrieval. An
embedding-based reranker is built in (uses cached vectors, no extra
LLM calls). Custom cross-encoder providers can also be used.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | — | Enable the reranking pass |
| `model` | `""` | — | Model name for the reranker (empty uses embedding-based) |
| `topN` | `20` | 1-100 | Number of candidates to pass to the reranker |
| `timeoutMs` | `2000` | 100-30000 ms | Timeout for the reranking call |


### Autonomous (`autonomous`)

Controls autonomous maintenance, repair, and mutation behavior.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Allow autonomous pipeline operations (maintenance, repair). |
| `frozen` | `false` | Block autonomous writes; autonomous reads still allowed. |
| `allowUpdateDelete` | `true` | Permit the pipeline to update or delete existing memories. |
| `maintenanceIntervalMs` | `1800000` | How often maintenance runs (30 min). Range: 60s-24h. |
| `maintenanceMode` | `"execute"` | `"observe"` logs issues; `"execute"` attempts repairs. |

In `"observe"` mode the worker emits structured log events but makes no
changes. When `frozen` is true, the maintenance interval never starts,
though the worker's `tick()` method remains callable for on-demand
inspection.


### Repair budgets (`repair`)

Repair sub-workers limit how aggressively they re-embed, re-queue, or
deduplicate items to avoid overloading providers.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `reembedCooldownMs` | `300000` | 10s-1h | Min time between re-embed batches |
| `reembedHourlyBudget` | `10` | 1-1000 | Max re-embed operations per hour |
| `requeueCooldownMs` | `60000` | 5s-1h | Min time between re-queue batches |
| `requeueHourlyBudget` | `50` | 1-1000 | Max re-queue operations per hour |
| `dedupCooldownMs` | `600000` | 10s-1h | Min time between dedup batches |
| `dedupHourlyBudget` | `3` | 1-100 | Max dedup operations per hour |
| `dedupSemanticThreshold` | `0.92` | 0.0-1.0 | Cosine similarity threshold for semantic dedup |
| `dedupBatchSize` | `100` | 10-1000 | Max candidates evaluated per dedup batch |


### Document ingest (`documents`)

Controls chunking for ingesting large documents into the memory store.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `workerIntervalMs` | `10000` | 1s-300s | Poll interval for pending document jobs |
| `chunkSize` | `2000` | 200-50000 | Target chunk size in characters |
| `chunkOverlap` | `200` | 0-10000 | Overlap between adjacent chunks (chars) |
| `maxContentBytes` | `10485760` | 1 KB-100 MB | Max document size accepted |

Chunk overlap ensures context is not lost at chunk boundaries. A value of
10-15% of `chunkSize` is a reasonable starting point.


### Guardrails (`guardrails`)

Content size limits applied during extraction and recall to prevent
oversized content from degrading pipeline performance.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `maxContentChars` | `500` | 50-100000 | Max characters stored per memory |
| `chunkTargetChars` | `300` | 50-50000 | Target chunk size for content splitting |
| `recallTruncateChars` | `500` | 50-100000 | Max characters returned per memory in recall results |

These limits are enforced at the pipeline level. Content exceeding
`maxContentChars` is truncated before storage. Recall results are
truncated at `recallTruncateChars` to keep session context budgets
predictable.


### Continuity (`continuity`)

Session checkpoint configuration for continuity recovery. Checkpoints
capture periodic snapshots of session state (focus, prompts, memory
activity) to aid recovery after context compaction or session restart.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | — | Master switch for session checkpoints |
| `promptInterval` | `10` | 1-1000 | Prompts between periodic checkpoints |
| `timeIntervalMs` | `900000` | 60s-1h | Time between periodic checkpoints (15 min default) |
| `maxCheckpointsPerSession` | `50` | 1-500 | Per-session checkpoint cap (oldest pruned) |
| `retentionDays` | `7` | 1-90 | Days before old checkpoints are hard-deleted |
| `recoveryBudgetChars` | `2000` | 200-10000 | Max characters for recovery digest |

Checkpoints are triggered by five events: `periodic`, `pre_compaction`,
`session_end`, `agent`, and `explicit`. Secrets are redacted before
storage.


### Telemetry (`telemetry`)

Anonymous usage telemetry. Only active when `telemetryEnabled: true`.
Events are batched and flushed periodically.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `posthogHost` | `""` | — | PostHog instance URL (empty disables) |
| `posthogApiKey` | `""` | — | PostHog project API key |
| `flushIntervalMs` | `60000` | 5s-10min | Time between event flushes |
| `flushBatchSize` | `50` | 1-500 | Max events per flush batch |
| `retentionDays` | `90` | 1-365 | Days before local telemetry data is purged |


### Embedding tracker (`embeddingTracker`)

Background polling loop that detects stale or missing embeddings and
refreshes them in small batches. Runs alongside the extraction pipeline.

| Field | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | — | Master switch |
| `pollMs` | `5000` | 1s-60s | Polling interval between refresh cycles |
| `batchSize` | `8` | 1-20 | Max embeddings refreshed per cycle |

The tracker detects embeddings that are missing, have a stale content
hash, or were produced by a different model than the currently configured
one. It uses `setTimeout` chains for natural backpressure.


Auth Config
-----------

Auth configuration lives under the `auth` key in `agent.yaml`. Signet
uses short-lived signed tokens for dashboard and API access.

```yaml
auth:
  mode: local
  defaultTokenTtlSeconds: 604800    # 7 days
  sessionTokenTtlSeconds: 86400     # 24 hours
  rateLimits:
    forget:
      windowMs: 60000
      max: 30
    modify:
      windowMs: 60000
      max: 60
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `"local"` | Auth mode: `"local"`, `"team"`, or `"hybrid"` |
| `defaultTokenTtlSeconds` | `604800` | API token lifetime (7 days) |
| `sessionTokenTtlSeconds` | `86400` | Session token lifetime (24 hours) |

In `"local"` mode the token secret is generated automatically and stored
at `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/auth-secret`. In `"team"` and `"hybrid"` modes,
wallet-based ERC-8128 signatures are used alongside or instead of local
tokens.


### Rate limits

Rate limits are sliding-window counters that reset on daemon restart.
Each key controls a category of potentially destructive operations.

| Operation | Default window | Default max | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `forget` | 60 s | 30 | Soft-delete a memory |
| `modify` | 60 s | 60 | Update memory content |
| `batchForget` | 60 s | 5 | Bulk soft-delete |
| `forceDelete` | 60 s | 3 | Hard-delete (bypasses tombstone) |
| `admin` | 60 s | 10 | Admin API operations |

Override any limit under `auth.rateLimits.<operation>`:

```yaml
auth:
  rateLimits:
    forceDelete:
      windowMs: 60000
      max: 1
```


Retention Config
----------------

The retention worker runs on a fixed interval and purges data that has
exceeded its retention window. It is not directly configurable in
`agent.yaml`; the defaults below are compiled in and apply unconditionally
when the pipeline is running.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `intervalMs` | `21600000` | Sweep frequency (6 hours) |
| `tombstoneRetentionMs` | `2592000000` | Soft-deleted memories kept for 30 days before hard purge |
| `historyRetentionMs` | `15552000000` | Memory history events kept for 180 days |
| `completedJobRetentionMs` | `1209600000` | Completed pipeline jobs kept for 14 days |
| `deadJobRetentionMs` | `2592000000` | Dead-letter jobs kept for 30 days |
| `batchLimit` | `500` | Max rows purged per step per sweep (backpressure) |

The retention worker also cleans up graph links and embeddings that
belong to purged tombstones, and orphans entity nodes with no remaining
mentions. The `batchLimit` prevents a single sweep from locking the
database for too long under high load.

Soft-deleted memories remain recoverable via `POST /api/memory/:id/recover`
until their tombstone window expires.


Hooks Config
------------

Controls what Signet injects during [[harnesses|harness]] lifecycle events.
See [[hooks]] for full details.

```yaml
hooks:
  sessionStart:
    recallLimit: 10
    includeIdentity: true
    includeRecentContext: true
    recencyBias: 0.7
  preCompaction:
    includeRecentMemories: true
    memoryLimit: 5
    summaryGuidelines: "Focus on technical decisions."
```

`hooks.sessionStart` controls what is injected at the start of a new
harness session:

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `recallLimit` | `10` | Number of memories to inject |
| `includeIdentity` | `true` | Include agent name and description |
| `includeRecentContext` | `true` | Include `MEMORY.md` content |
| `recencyBias` | `0.7` | Weight toward recent vs. important memories (0-1) |

`hooks.preCompaction` controls what is included when the harness triggers
a pre-compaction summary:

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `includeRecentMemories` | `true` | Include recent memories in the prompt |
| `memoryLimit` | `5` | How many recent memories to include |
| `summaryGuidelines` | built-in | Custom instructions for session summary |


Environment Variables
---------------------

Environment variables take precedence over `agent.yaml` for runtime
overrides. They are useful in containerized or CI environments where
editing the config file is impractical.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SIGNET_PATH` | — | Runtime override for agents directory |
| `SIGNET_PORT` | `3850` | Daemon HTTP port |
| `SIGNET_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Daemon host for local calls and default bind address |
| `SIGNET_BIND` | `SIGNET_HOST` | Explicit bind address override (`0.0.0.0`, etc.) |
| `SIGNET_LOG_FILE` | — | Optional explicit daemon log file path |
| `SIGNET_LOG_DIR` | `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/logs` | Optional daemon log directory override |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | OpenAI key when embedding provider is `openai` |

`SIGNET_PATH` changes where Signet reads and writes all agent data for
that process, including the config file itself. Use this for temporary
overrides in CI or isolated local testing.


AGENTS.md
---------

The main agent identity file. Synced to all configured harnesses on
change (2-second debounce). Write it in plain markdown — there is no
required structure, but a typical layout looks like this:

```markdown
# Agent Name

Short introduction paragraph.

## Personality

Communication style, tone, and approach.

## Instructions

Specific behaviors, preferences, and task guidance.

## Rules

Hard rules the agent must follow.

## Context

Background about the user and their work.
```

When `AGENTS.md` changes, the daemon writes updated copies to:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (if `~/.claude/` exists)
- `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (if `~/.config/opencode/` exists)

Each copy is prefixed with a generated header identifying the source file
and timestamp, and includes a warning not to edit the copy directly.


SOUL.md
-------

Optional personality file for deeper character definition. Loaded by
harnesses that support separate personality and instruction files.

```markdown
# Soul

## Voice
How the agent speaks and writes.

## Values
What the agent prioritizes.

## Quirks
Unique personality characteristics.
```


MEMORY.md
---------

Auto-generated working memory summary. Updated by the synthesis system.
Do not edit by hand — changes will be overwritten on the next synthesis
run. Loaded at session start when `hooks.sessionStart.includeRecentContext`
is `true`.


Database Schema
---------------

The SQLite database at `memory/memories.db` contains three main tables.

### memories

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT | Primary key (UUID) |
| `content` | TEXT | Memory content |
| `type` | TEXT | `fact`, `preference`, `decision`, `daily-log`, `episodic`, `procedural`, `semantic`, `system` |
| `source` | TEXT | Source system or harness |
| `importance` | REAL | 0-1 score, decays over time |
| `tags` | TEXT | Comma-separated tags |
| `who` | TEXT | Source harness name |

| `deleted_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp of soft-delete |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp |
| `last_accessed` | TEXT | Last access timestamp |
| `access_count` | INTEGER | Number of times recalled |
| `confidence` | REAL | Extraction confidence (0-1) |
| `version` | INTEGER | Optimistic concurrency version |
| `manual_override` | INTEGER | 1 if user has manually edited |

### embeddings

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT | Primary key (UUID) |
| `content_hash` | TEXT | SHA-256 hash of embedded text |
| `vector` | BLOB | Float32 array (raw bytes) |
| `dimensions` | INTEGER | Vector size (e.g. 768) |
| `source_type` | TEXT | `memory`, `conversation`, etc. |
| `source_id` | TEXT | Reference to parent memory UUID |
| `chunk_text` | TEXT | The text that was embedded |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO timestamp |

### memories_fts

FTS5 virtual table for keyword search. Indexes `content` and `tags`
from the `memories` table. An after-delete trigger keeps the FTS index
in sync when tombstones are hard-purged.


Harness-Specific Configuration
-------------------------------

### Claude Code

Location: `~/.claude/`

`settings.json` installs hooks that fire at session lifecycle events:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/memory/scripts/memory.py load --mode session-start",
        "timeout": 3000
      }]
    }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/memory/scripts/memory.py load --mode prompt",
        "timeout": 2000
      }]
    }],
    "SessionEnd": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/memory/scripts/memory.py save --mode auto",
        "timeout": 10000
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### OpenCode

Location: `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`

`signet.mjs` is a bundled OpenCode plugin installed by
`@signet/connector-opencode` that exposes `/remember` and `/recall`
as native tools within the harness.

> **Note:** Legacy `memory.mjs` installations are automatically migrated
> to `~/.config/opencode/plugins/signet.mjs` on reconnect.

### OpenClaw

Location: `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/hooks/agent-memory/` (hook directory)

Also configures the OpenClaw workspace in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
(and compatible `clawdbot` / `moltbot` config locations):

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "$SIGNET_WORKSPACE"
    }
  }
}
```

See [HARNESSES.md](./HARNESSES.md) for the full OpenClaw adapter docs.


Git Integration
---------------

If your Signet workspace is a git repository, the daemon auto-commits file changes
with a 5-second debounce after the last detected change. Commit messages
use the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS_auto_<filename>`. The setup wizard
offers to initialize git on first run and creates a backup commit before
making any changes.

Recommended `.gitignore` for your workspace:

```gitignore
.daemon/
.secrets/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.log
```
