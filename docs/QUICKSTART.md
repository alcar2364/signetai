Quickstart
===

Why Signet
---

Your agent starts every session from zero. It doesn't know what you
worked on yesterday. It doesn't know your preferences, your projects,
or the decisions you've already made together. Every session is a
first date.

The industry's answer to this has been to give agents memory tools —
"remember this," "recall that." That's not memory. That's a filing
cabinet the agent sometimes opens. It puts the LLM in charge of
deciding what's important, when to store it, and when to retrieve it.
You don't query a database to remember your coworker's name. It
surfaces because it's relevant.

Signet takes a different approach. The agent is not in the loop.

### The distillation layer

At the end of every conversation, Signet reviews the session and
distills it. A local LLM breaks the conversation into atomic facts,
checks them against what's already known, and decides: file as new,
update something existing, replace something outdated, or skip
entirely. Your agent won't store "prefers dark mode" fourteen times.

### The knowledge graph

Named entities — people, projects, tools, concepts — are extracted
and linked. When you ask about a project, Signet traverses the graph:
the project's architecture, the people involved, the tools it depends
on, the constraints that apply. Context arrives structured, not as a
pile of fragments.

### The predictive scorer

A neural network trained on your interaction patterns runs at inference
time. It observes the conversation context and predicts which memories
will be needed — before the agent asks, before a search is triggered.
The scorer is unique to each user. Your weights never leave your machine.

### Retrieval

Retrieval blends graph traversal, keyword search, and semantic
similarity into a single ranked result. The constellation view in the
dashboard lets you see your agent's knowledge topology.

### Document ingest

Feed any document into the distillation layer. PDFs, specs, reference
pages, URLs. They're chunked, embedded, and indexed alongside your
agent's insights.

### Safety guarantees

- **Raw-first**: content is persisted before any LLM processing begins
- **Pinned insights are sacred**: the distillation layer cannot modify
  them. Only you can.
- **Everything is recoverable**: deletions are soft, with a recovery
  window and full audit trail

The same agent follows you across Claude Code, OpenCode, and OpenClaw.
Same personality, same knowledge, same secrets. Switch tools without
starting over.

Prerequisites
---

- Node.js 18+ (or Bun 1.0+)
- One of: Ollama (for local embeddings) or an OpenAI API key
- macOS or Linux (Windows support planned)

---

Install
---

```bash
# bun (recommended)
bun add -g signetai

# npm
npm install -g signetai

# or one-line installer
curl -sL https://signetai.sh/install | bash
```

Running `signet setup` launches an interactive wizard that walks you through
the full setup. You don't need to read anything else first. Signet records
your primary package manager during setup and reuses it for skill installs
and update commands.

For agent-driven onboarding, use non-interactive mode:

```bash
signet setup --non-interactive \
  --name "My Agent" \
  --harness claude-code \
  --embedding-provider ollama \
  --extraction-provider claude-code
```

In non-interactive mode, agents should ask the user to choose both
providers first, then pass those choices explicitly.

---

Setup Wizard
---

The wizard asks a series of questions:

**1. Agent name**

Pick a name for your agent — this appears in harness prompts and the
dashboard.

**2. Harnesses**

Select which AI platforms you use. Signet will configure integrations
for each:

- Claude Code — hooks + CLAUDE.md sync
- OpenCode — plugin + AGENTS.md sync
- OpenClaw — adapter-openclaw hooks
- Codex — wrapper install + session hooks

**3. Embedding provider**

Embeddings power semantic (meaning-based) memory search. Choose:

- **Built-in** (recommended) — no extra setup required.
- **Ollama** — runs locally, free, no API key needed.
  Setup checks your binary, service, and model, and guides install/pull
  when needed.
- **OpenAI** — uses the OpenAI embeddings API. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Skip** — memory still works via keyword search, just no semantic search.

**4. Embedding model**

For Ollama, `nomic-embed-text` is a good default. Setup can pull it for
you (with confirmation), or you can do it manually:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

**5. Search balance**

The `alpha` setting controls how much weight goes to semantic vs. keyword
search. 0.7 (70% semantic, 30% keyword) works well for most people.

**6. Git & auto-commit**

The wizard can initialize a git repo in `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/` so every change to
your agent files is automatically versioned.

After the wizard completes, the [[daemon]] starts automatically and the
[[dashboard]] opens at `http://localhost:3850`.

What Signet Does
---

Once running, Signet gives you a persistent agent identity that works
across all your AI tools. The core features:

- **[[pipeline|Memory pipeline]]** — conversations are processed automatically by
  Pipeline V2, which extracts meaningful facts and decisions using a
  local LLM (default: `qwen3:4b` via Ollama). Memories accumulate over
  time and are recalled in future sessions.
- **Hybrid search** — recall combines semantic and keyword search so
  you find relevant memories even when phrasing varies.
- **Connectors** — platform adapters for Claude Code, OpenCode, and
  OpenClaw keep your agent config in sync across tools.
- **Analytics** — the dashboard tracks memory growth, session activity,
  and pipeline health over time.
- **Document ingest** — feed local files or URLs into the memory pipeline
  to give your agent persistent knowledge about a codebase, spec, or doc.
- **Diagnostics** — built-in health checks and pipeline status endpoints
  help you spot issues fast.
- **SDK** — embed Signet into your own apps via `@signet/sdk`.
- **Secrets** — API keys stored encrypted at rest, never exposed to agents
  directly.
- **Skills** — installable instruction packages that extend agent behavior.
- **Auth** — wallet-based identity (ERC-8128) for team deployments and
  sync. See [Auth](./AUTH.md) for details.

---

Basic Usage
---

### Check status

```bash
signet status
```

Shows daemon state, file health, and memory count.

### Open the dashboard

```bash
signet dashboard
```

Opens `http://localhost:3850` in your browser. From here you can edit
your agent config, browse memories, view analytics, and manage skills.
You can also reach it directly in your browser any time the daemon is
running.

### Save a memory

Use the CLI or `/remember` command in any connected harness:

```bash
# CLI
signet remember "nicholai prefers bun over npm"
signet remember "critical memory" --critical
signet remember "tagged memory" -t project,signet

# In harness
/remember nicholai prefers bun over npm
/remember critical: never commit secrets to git
/remember [project,signet]: daemon runs on port 3850
```

The `critical:` prefix or `--critical` flag pins a memory so it never
decays. The `[tag1,tag2]:` prefix or `-t` flag adds searchable tags.

You can also let the pipeline do this automatically — at the end of a
session, Pipeline V2 reads the conversation and extracts memories on its
own. Manual `/remember` is for things you want to ensure are captured.

### Search memories

```bash
# CLI
signet recall "coding preferences"
signet recall "signet" --type decision -l 5

# In harness
/recall coding preferences
/recall signet architecture
/recall what did we decide about authentication
```

### View daemon logs

```bash
signet daemon logs
signet daemon logs -n 100
```

### Stop/start the daemon

```bash
signet daemon stop
signet daemon start
signet daemon restart
```

---

Managing Secrets
---

Store API keys and other sensitive values encrypted at rest:

```bash
# Add a secret (value is never echoed)
signet secret put OPENAI_API_KEY

# List stored secrets (names only)
signet secret list

# Remove a secret
signet secret delete GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Secrets are encrypted with libsodium using a machine-bound key. Agents
never see secret values directly.

---

Managing Skills
---

Skills are packaged instructions in `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/skills/`. They extend
what your agent can do.

```bash
# See what's installed
signet skill list

# Search the skills.sh registry
signet skill search browser

# Install a skill
signet skill install browser-use

# Remove a skill
signet skill remove weather
```

---

Install as a System Service
---

To have Signet start automatically on boot:

```bash
cd packages/daemon
bun run install:service
```

**macOS (launchd):**
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.signet.daemon.plist
```

**Linux (systemd):**
```bash
systemctl --user enable signet.service
systemctl --user start signet.service
```

---

Editing Your Agent
---

Your agent identity lives in two key files:

**`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/AGENTS.md`** — What the agent knows and how it should
behave. This is the file that syncs to all your harnesses.

**`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/SOUL.md`** — Personality, voice, values. Mostly for your
own reference or for harnesses that load it separately.

Edit them directly in your editor or via the dashboard's config editor.
Changes sync to harnesses automatically within 2 seconds.

---

Auth and Team Deployments
---

Signet uses ERC-8128 wallet-based signatures for identity verification.
For personal use you don't need to think about this — it's handled
automatically. For team deployments or self-hosted sync servers, auth
modes let you scope memory access and control who can write to a shared
agent. See [Auth](./AUTH.md) and [Self-Hosting](./SELF-HOSTING.md) for
setup details.

---

Troubleshooting
---

**Daemon won't start**

Check if port 3850 is in use:
```bash
lsof -i :3850
```

Remove a stale PID file if needed:
```bash
rm $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/pid
signet daemon start
```

**Embeddings not working**

Make sure Ollama is running:
```bash
ollama serve &
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Or check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment (or stored
as a secret and referenced in `agent.yaml`).

**Changes not syncing to Claude Code**

Make sure `~/.claude/` exists and you have the harness configured:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
signet status
```

**Dashboard not loading**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3850/health
signet daemon logs
```
